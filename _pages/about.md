Hello, I'm An-Sheng Lee, an assistant professor at [Marine Core Research Institute](https://www.kochi-u.ac.jp/marine-core/en/), Kochi University. My research integrates advanced analytical techniques like XRF core scanning with ML models to extract hidden patterns from the geological record. In advance, promote automation on tedious labroatory works. A key aspect of my work ([Unit for International Joint Research Promotion: Core DX Promotion](https://www.kochi-u.ac.jp/marine-core/en/about/reorg.html)) involves the rediscovery and digital preservation of repository cores, creating high-resolution digital archives that can be mined for new scientific insights.

I hold a binational doctoral degree from the University of Bremen and National Taiwan University. During my PhD, I was awarded several prestigious grants, including the "[Impulse Grants for Research Projects](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/research/support-for-researchers/calls/crdf-calls/01-impulse-grants-for-research-pojects)" from the University of Bremen, the "Green Energy Scholarship Programme" from Ã˜rsted Taiwan, and the "[Kontaktstipendium, STIBET Doktoranden](https://www.daad.de/de/infos-services-fuer-hochschulen/weiterfuehrende-infos-zu-daad-foerderprogrammen/stibet-doktoranden/)" from the DAAD.

Recently in collabration with [Computational Learning Lab](https://learner.csie.ntu.edu.tw/start) and [Environment and Nanomaterial Lab](https://www.nanoenv.gl.ntu.edu.tw/) in National Taiwan University building foundation models for transforming X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data into various geological/geochemical proxies. The input data and knowledge are shared by the collaboration with [GEOPOLAR](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/ifg/institute/geomorphology-and-polar-research), [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de/en/), [Repository Core Re-Discovery Program](https://j-desc.org/en/record), and [NIOZ](https://www.nioz.nl/en). The pilot result is published on [JGR: Machine Learning and Computation](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025JH000754). We are welcoming any collaboration and feedback on this project.
