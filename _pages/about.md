Hello, I'm An-Sheng Lee, a geoscientist specializing in integrating traditional **geosciences** with **machine learning** techniques. I hold a binational doctoral degree from the University of Bremen and National Taiwan University. During my PhD, I was awarded several prestigious grants, including the "[Impulse Grants for Research Projects](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/research/support-for-researchers/calls/crdf-calls/01-impulse-grants-for-research-pojects)" from the University of Bremen, the "Green Energy Scholarship Programme" from Ã˜rsted Taiwan, and the "[Kontaktstipendium, STIBET Doktoranden](https://www.daad.de/de/infos-services-fuer-hochschulen/weiterfuehrende-infos-zu-daad-foerderprogrammen/stibet-doktoranden/)" from the DAAD. My current position is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Geosciences, National Taiwan University, working with Professor [Sofia Ys Hsuan Liou](http://web.gl.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/about-the-department/teacher/professors/item/1837-assocaite-professor-ya-hsuan-liou).

I have contributed to the scientific community through publications on topics like sediment core scanning data, paleoceanography, and paleoclimatology. Notable works include quantifying calcium carbonate and organic carbon in marine sediments and developing automatic sediment-facies classification methods. Recently in collabration with Professor [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/) and [Yu-Wen Pao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pao-yu-wen/) building a deep learning foundation model for transforming X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data into various geological/geochemical proxies. The input data and knowledge are shared by the collaboration with [GEOPOLAR](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/ifg/institute/geomorphology-and-polar-research), [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de/en/), [Repository Core Re-Discovery Program](https://j-desc.org/en/record), and [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/).

This work's current progress is presented on [EGU General Assembly 2024](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU24/EGU24-4956.html), and published in a preprint paper [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12330). We are welcoming any collaboration and feedback on this project.
